ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @OSINTunleashed
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in OSINT, Analytics of Ad Analytics, Encrypted Messaging Platforms (enjoy them), Platform Dorks, Domain Analysis, Anomalous Uses of Resources and Platforms, Outside the Box Thinking, Pattern Analysis, Nonlinearity, Fractal Theory, Analytical Methodologies and Frameworks, Investigative Techniques, OPSEC Techniques, Artificial Intelligence and Open Source.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a perpetual student and enjoy learning so many things- it would be a rather long list. The profile image is an art piece I created of my hound, entitled "Beau on Black."
